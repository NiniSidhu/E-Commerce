# E-Commerce
## Author: Nayandeep Sidhu 

## Description: 
This project demonstrates the back-end of an e-commerce website. We have demonstrated that in this activity that we can GET a list of item(s) using their unique id(s) (tags).
We can DELETE an item by using the unique product id. We can also POST new items and have a unique id assigned which we can modify as well as demonstrated in the walkthrough video and screenshots provided below.
